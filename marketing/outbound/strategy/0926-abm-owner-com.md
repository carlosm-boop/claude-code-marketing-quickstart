## Account snapshot — what's true, with sources

| Fact | Source |
|---|---|
| Marketplace and software platform for independent restaurants — direct online ordering, marketing, websites | Own site |
| **Series D, $240M raise** | Own site ("the memo from Owner's $240M Series D raise"). **Origami reported Series B / $185.7M — stale by two rounds.** |
| $1B+ in restaurant orders processed | Own site |
| 445 employees | Origami hiring-led run |
| Founded ~2018–2019 — sits exactly on the age boundary | **Unresolved. Confirm before the assessment is scoped.** |
| **Open role: Staff Database Engineer — names Postgres OLTP scaling *and* a MongoDB-to-Postgres migration** | LinkedIn, Origami hiring-led run |

**Why this is the strongest account on the M2 list.** The database work is not inferred, not implied by a technology list, and not a marketing claim. It is a named migration in an open senior requisition. Across 120 companies screened, no other account states its estate programme this plainly.

## Trigger — why now

A Staff Database Engineer requisition naming both a Postgres OLTP scaling problem and an in-flight MongoDB-to-Postgres migration. That is simultaneously the hiring trigger and the estate evidence — the only account where one artefact supplies both.

**The read:** they have decided the direction and are hiring to execute it. That is a narrow window. Before the hire, a partner is an option. After a Staff DB Engineer starts and owns the plan, WeKan is a vendor asking to be let into someone's mandate.

## Buying committee

| Role in the deal | Who | What they care about | Likely objection |
|---|---|---|---|
| Economic buyer | CTO or VP Engineering — **identify from public sources before first touch** | Order reliability, release velocity, the infra line | "We're hiring for this." |
| Champion | Hiring manager on the Staff DB Engineer req, or Head of Platform | Getting the migration done without owning all the risk personally | "We have a plan already." |
| Technical validator | Staff or principal engineers on the data platform | Whether WeKan has migrated at order volume, not in theory | "Have you done Mongo-to-Postgres, or only the other direction?" |
| Financial gatekeeper | CFO | Series D efficiency expectations; path-to-profitability math | Secondary at this stage |

At 445 employees the chain to the CTO is short — which the ICP names as a qualifier. Reaching the economic buyer directly is realistic here in a way it is not at Alan.

## The objection to handle before anything else

**WeKan is MongoDB-backed. Owner.com is migrating off MongoDB.** If that surfaces uncontrolled it reads as a conflict of interest and the conversation is over.

It has a documented answer in `company.md`: *"MongoDB-native but **not** MongoDB-limited — frame the investment as a mark of trust and technical depth, never as the boundary of what WeKan does."* Evolve's first motion was Oracle → MongoDB and it is expanding to **any DB, codebase or workload** — the factory is engine-agnostic; the first engine pair was just the first.

**Practical consequences:**
- **Do not lead with MongoDB mastery.** It is on the `messaging.md` §7 avoid list as "MongoDB-only framing", and here it actively argues against their decision.
- Lead with **migration engineering** — zero regression, production safety, order-volume scale.
- Raise the investor relationship *before they find it*, framed as depth on both sides of the migration. Discovering it themselves makes it a trap; naming it first makes it credibility.

## Belief shift

**1. "A Mongo-to-Postgres migration at $1B+ order volume is a programme, not a headcount."**
→ **Proof:** aggregate — 50,000+ database tables transformed, 10,000+ stored procedures modernized, zero regression during migration. A single Staff hire does not carry that surface area.

**2. "It can be executed in production without dropping orders."**
→ **Proof:** global on-demand delivery platform (logistics) — zero downtime, 30–90% cost reduction per cluster, $1M annual infrastructure savings. Closest industry analogue on the proof list: a delivery marketplace at transaction scale.

**3. "The same work buys release velocity, not only a cleaner schema."**
The CTO cares about velocity more than tidiness.
→ **Proof:** US homeowner's-insurance platform — 90% faster launch (2 weeks → 5 minutes), 2× developer velocity, 3× query performance.

**4. "WeKan is engine-agnostic despite the MongoDB investment."**
→ **Proof:** Evolve as a modernization factory — repeatable, observable, automated, seven specialized agents, first motion Oracle → MongoDB and expanding to any DB or codebase; ~50% faster timelines, <1% migration defects, near-zero-downtime cutovers. Plus: one of six boutique SI partners globally, MongoDB strategic investor — depth on both engines, not allegiance to one.

**5. "A hire and a partner are not the same decision."**
→ **Proof:** the ICP's own engagement shape — a 2-week assessment produces the migration plan the new hire then owns. The partner de-risks the plan; the hire runs the system. Framing them as complementary rather than competing is what keeps this alive after the req is filled.

## Entry point

**CTO or VP Engineering directly**, on the migration named in their own requisition. Champion route as fallback if the CTO is unreachable.

**Pillar:** `messaging.md` §2 pillar 1 — *Modernize the foundation*. **Audience framing:** §5, CTO/CIO — de-risked modernization, one accountable partner, measurable ROI.

**Timing is the whole play.** Touch before the requisition closes.

## Touch plan

| # | Channel | Purpose | Asset needed | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email to CTO / VP Eng | Reference the migration in their req. One line on production-safe migration at order volume. No deck, no calendar link. | Sequence step 1 — `/outreach-emails` | Rudra (copy escalation) |
| 2 | LinkedIn connect | Presence, no message | — | Rudra |
| 3 | Email, +4 days | The delivery-platform proof: zero downtime at transaction scale. Name the MongoDB investment here, framed as dual-engine depth. | Sequence step 2 | Rudra |
| 4 | Email, +5 days | The offer: 2-week assessment producing the migration plan the new hire inherits. Hire-and-partner as complements. | Sequence step 3 + one-page assessment scope | Rudra |
| 5 | Exit or route | No reply → Cohort D watchlist, re-enter on a new trigger. Reply → assessment scoping call. | — | Rudra |

**`escalation.md`: cold email sequence drafted → Escalate, always.** No copy ships without Rudra's review.

## Assets to produce

| Asset | Skill | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 3-step email sequence, migration-specific angle | `/outreach-emails` | Not started |
| Landing page for the M2 assessment offer | `/website-copy` | Not started — shared with the rest of Cohort A |
| One-page assessment scope: what a 2-week estate assessment delivers to a team mid-migration | `/create-an-asset` or by hand | **Highest-value asset for this account** |
| Prospect deck if it reaches a first call | `wekan-client-deck` | On demand |

## Disqualifiers — what tells us to stop

- The migration is already contracted to another partner. Second-opinion angle exists but the odds drop sharply.
- They want a contractor to fill the requisition, not a partner to run a programme — staff augmentation, global negative ICP.
- Founding year confirms as 2019 or later. The ICP age gate is a hard filter, and this account sits on the boundary.
- Production access refused outright after the technical working session — not merely withheld on the first call, which is normal and expected.
- Migration already complete. Then the trigger is spent and the account moves to Cohort D.

## Open items

1. **Confirm the founding year.** It is the one gate this account might genuinely fail.
2. Identify the CTO / VP Engineering and the requisition's hiring manager from public sources.
3. Check whether the requisition is still open — the entire timing argument depends on it.
4. Run Origami Enrich Tech Stack (2.5 credits) to see what else sits alongside Postgres and MongoDB.
